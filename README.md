# Salifort Motors Employee Retention Analytics

## Overview

Salifort Motors Employee Retention Analytics Capstone Project! In this project, we will be exploring and analyzing data from a recent employee survey to develop insights and create a predictive model for employee retention at Salifort Motors, a leading French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.

## About Salifort Motors

Salifort Motors is a global leader in the production of alternative energy vehicles, specializing in electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. With a workforce of over 100,000 employees engaged in research, design, construction, validation, and distribution, Salifort Motors is at the forefront of the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.

## Business Case

As a data specialist for Salifort Motors, we analyze the results of a recent employee survey and develop a model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. The senior leadership team is particularly interested in understanding the factors influencing employee retention, such as department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant data points.

## Deliverables

The primary deliverable will be a predictive model designed to identify employees at risk of leaving the company. Either a regression model or a tree-based machine learning model for this purpose. Analysis and findings will provide valuable insights for the senior leadership team to formulate strategies and interventions aimed at improving employee retention.
